\section{Purpose}
In this lab, Pfund's Method and Snell's Law will be used to determine the index of refraction of an unknown liquid. 
Two methods will be used to find this index of refraction, the first utilizing Pfund's Method, while the second uses Snell's Law.
The index of refraction of the glass petri dish is determined via Pfund's Method. This then allows us to proceed with both methods. 
As light is refracted through a medium, a small circular region is observed, surrounded by a darker region with a radius that can be used to calculate the unknown index of refraction via Pfund's Law.
In the second method, the incident and reflected angles of the light are measured and plugged into Snell's Law. We can compare the two calculated values to determine the unknown substance.

\section{Calculations}
\subsection*{Part A: Pfund's Method}
\noindent \textbf{1. Index of Refraction $\bm{({n_{\textbf{glass}}})}$}\[n_{\textnormal{glass}}=\frac{\sqrt{d^2+16t^2}}{d}\]
    Before the index of refraction of the liquid $(n_\text{liquid})$ could be found, we must first find the index of refraction of our petri dishes $(n_\text{glass})$. Here, $d$ represents the diameter of the ring of light reflected by the glass and $t$ represents the thickness of the petri dish. When solving for $n_\text{glass}$ mean values of $d$ and $t$ were used. The error of each measurement was propagated through this calculation using the following equations. 
\subsubsection*{Error Propagation:}
    \noindent\textbf{1.1 Partial Derivative of Eq. 1 w.r.t $\bm d$}\[\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{glass}}}{\partial d}=-\dfrac{16t^2}{d^2\sqrt{d^2+16t^2}}\]
    \textbf{1.2 Partial Derivative of Eq. 1 w.r.t $\bm t$} \[\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{glass}}}{\partial t}=\dfrac{16t}{d\sqrt{16t^2+d^2}}\]
    Each of these partial derivatives are used in the final calculation of the total error associated with $n_\text{glass}.$ Because $d$ and $t$ are both independent variables we use the following equation to find the total error.\\
    \textbf{1.3 Total Error Associated with the Index of Refraction $\bm{({n_{\textbf{glass}}})}$}\[\delta n_{\textnormal{glass}} =\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{glass}}}{\partial t}\delta t\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{glass}}}{\partial d}\delta d\right)^2}\]
    The error associated with each set of measurements was calculated (shown in the results section). The mean of those values provides our final error associated with $(n_\text{glass})$.\\
\\\textbf{2. Index of Refraction $\bm{({n_{\textbf{liquid}}})}$}\[n_{\textnormal{liquid}}=\frac{n_{\textnormal{glass}}d}{\sqrt{d^2+16t^2}}\]
    We proceed to calculate $(n_\text{liquid})$, which relies on $(n_\text{glass})$ (calculated above), the diameter $d$ of the first ring reflected by the liquid, and the thickness of the petri dish $t$. The total error of $(n_\text{liquid})$ is found using the following equations.
\subsubsection*{Error Propagation:}
    \noindent\textbf{2.1 Partial Derivative of Eq. 2 w.r.t $\bm d$}\[\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{liquid}}}{\partial d}=\dfrac{16n_\textnormal{glass}t^2}{\left(d^2+16t^2\right)^\frac{3}{2}}\]
    \textbf{2.2 Partial Derivative of Eq. 2 w.r.t $\bm t$} \[\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{liquid}}}{\partial t}=-\dfrac{16dn_\text{glass}t}{\left(16t^2+d^2\right)^\frac{3}{2}}\]
    \textbf{2.3 Partial Derivative of Eq. 2 w.r.t $\bm n_\textbf{glass}$}\[\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{liquid}}}{\partial n_\text{glass}}=\dfrac{d}{\sqrt{16t^2+d^2}}\]
    Each of these partial derivatives are used in calculating the total error in the following equation. All of the variables ($(n_\text{glass}), d, \text{and } t$) are independent, which allows us to use the same process as above (Equation 1.3).\\
    \textbf{2.4 Total Error Associated with the Index of Refraction $\bm{({n_{\textbf{liquid}}})}$}\[\delta n_{\textnormal{liquid}} =\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{liquid}}}{\partial t}\delta t\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{liquid}}}{\partial d}\delta d\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial n_{\textnormal{liquid}}}{\partial n_{\text{glass}}}\delta n_{\text{glass}}\right)^2}\]
    As in Equation 1.3, this equation gives us the total error associated with $(n_\text{liquid})$. The mean of these error values provided us with our final error associated with our mean $(n_\text{liquid})$ value, shown in the results section.
\subsection*{Part B: Snell's Law}
\noindent\textbf{3. The Law of Refraction (Snell's Law)}\[n_1\sin{\theta_1}=n_2\sin{\theta_2}\Rightarrow n_2=\frac{n_1\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2}\]
    Part B of the experiment requires us to employ the Law of Refraction, also known as Snell's Law, to find the index of refraction of the liquid, which we'll refer to as $n_2$. In this equation, $\theta_1$ refers to the incident angle (the angle at which the light enters the medium) and $\theta_2$ refers to the refracted angle (the angle at which the light exits the medium). The final error associated with $n_2$ is given by the following process. 
\subsubsection*{Error Propagation}
\noindent\textbf{3.1 Partial Derivative of Eq. 3 w.r.t $\bm \theta_1$}\[\frac{\partial n_2}{\partial\theta_1}=\dfrac{n_1\cos\left({\theta}_1\right)}{\sin\left({\theta}_2\right)}\]
\textbf{3.2 Partial Derivative of Eq. 3 w.r.t $\bm \theta_2$}\[\frac{\partial n_2}{\partial\theta_2}=-\dfrac{n_1\sin\left({\theta}_1\right)\cos\left({\theta}_2\right)}{\sin^2\left({\theta}_2\right)}\]
    Each of these partial derivatives are used in the following equation to find the total error associated with $n_2$. Because $n_1$ was a given value of the index of refraction of air, there is no error associated with that measurement, so it will not factor into the total error. $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are dependent variables, which allows us to use the following equation to find the total error.\\
\textbf{3.3 Total Error Associated with the Index of Refraction $\bm{({n_{2}})}$}\[\delta n_2= \left|\left(\frac{\partial n_2}{\partial \theta_1}\delta\theta_1\right)\right|+\left|\left(\frac{\partial n_2}{\partial \theta_2}\delta\theta_2\right)\right|\] 
    The total error was calculated using this equation for each set of measured angles. The mean of the calculated $n_2$ values alongside the mean error value ($\delta n_2$) provided our final value of the index of refraction of the liquid.
