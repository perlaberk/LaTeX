\section{Purpose}
In this experiment, the wave nature of light will be analyzed by observing how a laser beam interacts with certain obstacles and openings.
First, the wavelength of the laser beam will be determined through the N-slit experiment.
The light will pass through a grating with 1,000 lines/mm onto a screen, and the location of the intensity maxima will then be used to calculate the wavelength. 
After determining this wavelength, a single slit is created using a Vernier caliper, and the wavelength is determined using the minima from the diffraction pattern generated by the slit.
The diameter of a human hair can then be determined using Babinet's principle which states that the diffraction pattern of a shape is identical to the diffraction pattern of a screen with the shape cut out of it. 
Here, the diffraction pattern of the hair is identical to the diffraction pattern of an opaque screen with a slit that has the same width as the hair.

\section{Calculations}
\subsection*{Part A: Determination of a Laser's Wavelength}
\noindent \textbf{1. Intensity due to the interference of $\bm{N}$ sources}\[I(\delta)=I_0\left[\frac{\sin(\frac{N\delta}{2})}{\sin(\frac{\delta}{2})}\right]^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \delta=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}d\sin\theta\]
Here, $d$ is the distance between slits, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light, and $\theta$ is the angle between the center of the incident beam of light and the point of interest on the screen. 
In our experiment, we were interested in the peaks of the interference pattern.\\
\textbf{1.1 Determining $\bm{\theta}$}\[\tan\theta=\frac{x_m}{D}\Rightarrow\theta=\arctan\frac{x_m}{D} \quad m=0,\pm1\pm2,\dots\]
Where $D$ is the distance between the grating and the screen, and $x_m$ represents the distance between the center and each of the principal maxima.
\subsubsection*{Error Propagation:}
    \noindent\textbf{1.1.1 Partial Derivative of Eq. 1.1 w.r.t $\bm{D}$}\[\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial D}=\frac{-x_m}{D^2+x_m^2}\]
    \textbf{1.1.2 Partial Derivative of Eq 1.1 w.r.t $\bm{x_m}$}\[\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial x_m}=\frac{D}{x_m^2+D^2}\]
    Using the above partial derivatives, we can calculate the total error associated with $\theta.$ Because $D$ and $x_m$ are dependant variables, we use the following equation to compute the total error.\\
    \textbf{1.1.3 Total Error Associated with $\bm{\theta}$}\[\delta\theta=\left|\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial D}\delta D\right|+\left|\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial x_m}\delta x_m\right|\]
\noindent\textbf{2. Principal Maxima Locations}\[\sin\theta=\frac{m\lambda}{d} \quad m=0,\pm1,\pm2,\dots\]
    Here $m$ refers to each of the principal maxima. For example in Table 1, the $x_{+1}$ column refers to the $m=1$ maxima
\subsubsection*{Error Propagation:}
    \noindent\textbf{2.1 Partial Derivative of Eq. 2 w.r.t $\bm d$}\[\frac{\partial\lambda}{\partial d}=\frac{\sin\theta}{m}\]
    \textbf{2.2 Partial Derivative of Eq. 2 w.r.t $\bm \theta$} \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}=\frac{d}{m}\cos\theta\]
    \textbf{2.3 Partial Derivative of Eq. 2 w.r.t $\bm m$} \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial m}=\frac{-d\sin\theta}{m^2}\]
    Each of these partial derivatives are used in the final calculation of the total error associated with $\lambda.$ These variables are independent, which allows us to use the following equation to calculate the total error.\\
    \textbf{2.4 Total Error Associated with the Wavelength $\bm{(\lambda)}$}\[\delta \lambda =\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial d}\delta d\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial \theta}\delta \theta\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial m}\delta m\right)^2}\]
    In our experiment, $m$ represents the number of the principal maxima, so there is no error associated with it. The total error associated with the mean values were calculated (shown in the Results section). This provides our final error associated with $\lambda$.\\
\subsection*{Part B: Single Slit Diffraction}
    \noindent\textbf{3. Intensity due to a Single Slit}\[I(\beta)=I_0\left(\frac{\sin\beta}{\beta}\right)^2\quad where \quad \beta=\frac{\pi}{\lambda}a\sin\theta\]
    Here, $a$ is the width of the slit and $\lambda$ and $\theta$ are as given in Equation 1.\\
\textbf{4. Minima of the Diffraction Pattern Locations} \[\sin\theta=\frac{p\lambda}{a} \quad p=0,\pm1,\pm2,\dots\]
This equation matches with Equation 2, where $a$ is analogous to $d$ and $p$ is analogous to $m$. When determining the error in calculating the wavelengths for a single slit, the Standard Deviation of the Mean is calculated.\\    
\textbf{4.1 Error Calculation: Standard Deviation of the Mean (SDOM)}\[\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{S_x}{\sqrt{N}}\]
    Where $S_x$ is the standard deviation of the data and $N$ is the number of data points. For our single slit wavelength calculations, 12 values for the wavelength were calculated, meaning $N=12$.
\subsection*{Determination of a Hair's Thickness}
\noindent\textbf{5. Slit Thickness}\[a=\frac{\lambda p}{\sin\theta}\]
Rearranging Equation 4 to solve for the slit width gives this equation, which allows us to calculate the thickness of the hair, given the value of $\lambda$. 
To determine the error of the hair's thickness, the SDOM was calculated, using Equation 4.1, where $N=6$, since there were thickness values for the first, second, and third order peaks.

\section{Conclusion}
The wavelength of a red laser beam was calculated using an N-slit interference pattern to be  $6.685*10^{-5} \pm 4.3*10^{-7}$ cm. Using a single slit interference pattern, with various slit widths, the wavelength was determined to be $6.320*10^{-5}\pm 2.8*10^{-6}$ cm.
Both of these wavelength values lie within the expected wavelength of red light, which varies between 630 nm and 670 nm.
Based on the calculated wavelength of the single slit diffraction, the thickness of a human hair was determined using Babinet's principle to be $0.009 \pm 0.0006$ cm. 
This thickness lies within the accepted thickness of a hair, which varies between $15 \mu$m and $181 \mu$m based on the type of hair used.
Although the experimental values of wavelength and hair thickness lie within their accepted ranges, there were many sources of error within the experiment. 
Further experimental measurements can provide greater accuracy for the wavelength and thickness calculations.
Once the sources of error are reduced, a more accurate value can be calculated via both the N-slit and single slit diffraction.

\section{Questions}
\subsection*{1. Explain why $(\sin\theta=\frac{m\lambda}{d},\quad m=0,\pm1,\pm2,\dots)$ is so. You will have to take the appropriate limits for Equation 1 $\left(I(\delta)=I_0\left[\frac{\sin\frac{N\delta}{2}}{\sin\frac{\delta}{2}}\right]^2, \delta= \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}d\sin\theta\right)$}
\noindent This equation comes from the limit of the maxima of the intensity for an N-slit diffraction pattern, given in the above equation.
\[\lim_{\delta\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\sin(N\delta)}{\sin\delta}=\frac{0}{0}\]
Using L'Hopital's Rule
\[\lim_{\delta\rightarrow\infty}\frac{N\cos(N\delta)}{\cos\delta}=\frac{-N}{-1}=N\]
\[I(\delta)\text{at maxima } (\pi,2\pi,\dots)=I_0N^2\]
\[\delta=\pi,2\pi,\dots,m\pi,  m\in \mathbb{Z}\]
\[\sin\theta=\frac{\delta\lambda}{2\pi d}=\frac{m\pi\lambda}{2\pi d}=\frac{m\lambda}{d} \quad m\in\mathbb{Z}\quad\text{as desired.}\]
\subsection*{2. Explain how we arrive at $\left(\sin\theta=\frac{p\lambda}{a}, p=\pm1,\pm2,\dots\right)$ from Equation 3 $\left(I(\beta)=I_0\left(\frac{\sin\beta}{\beta}\right)^2 \right)$}
\noindent This equation comes from the minima of the intensity for a single slit diffraction pattern, which occurs when $\frac{\pi}{\lambda}a\sin\theta=\pi,2\pi,\dots, m\pi,\quad m\in\mathbb{Z}$.
\[\frac{\pi}{\lambda}a\sin\theta=m\pi\]
\[\sin\theta=\frac{m\pi\lambda}{\pi a}=\frac{m\lambda}{a}\quad\text{as desired.}\]
